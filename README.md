# Mama-To-Be
is my final project made for my Python Web-Development curriculum. As my wife was very pregnant at the moment
I figured I can make a project that she can adapt into something like an overengineered blog that can bring some
value to to-be-mothers.
Project is still in production, and will be deployed if I decide that the 'final' result is of value
