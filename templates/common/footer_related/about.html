<h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hi, and welcome to my blog.</p>

    <p>
        I’m a Bulgarian mom living in Vienna with my husband and toddler. 
        After more than a decade abroad, Vienna has truly become home — a place where I balance family life, work, and the simple things that make everyday living enjoyable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, I share glimpses of my life as a mom and expat — from cooking homemade meals and keeping a cozy home, to exploring Vienna’s parks, events, and little corners with my son. 
        I also love sharing small pieces of my personal style, the occasional outfit of the day, and how I make time for myself — skincare, a quiet moment, or a walk through the city.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This blog is a mix of stories, routines, and reflections — nothing overcomplicated, just life as it happens. I hope you find something here that feels familiar, inspiring, or simply pleasant to read.
    </p>
